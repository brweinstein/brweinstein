I’m an Honours Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo with a strong interest in software, statistics, and full-stack development. I enjoy building projects end-to-end, from low-level logic in Rust to polished web interfaces. Recently, I’ve worked on high-performance CLI utilities, data analysis and statistical workflows, and interactive web applications.
